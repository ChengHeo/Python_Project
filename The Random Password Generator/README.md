### Scenario

The password generator is a Random Password generating program that generates a password mix of upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols strong enough to provide great security.
The examples of random passwords shown should have a minimum of 8 digits to a maximum of 16 digits. 

#### We need to bulid a generator to produce a random password with the python

Step as below:
1. [Algorithm](https://github.com/ChengHeo/Python_Project/blob/main/The%20Random%20Password%20Generator/1.0%20Algorithm)
2. [Flowchart](https://github.com/ChengHeo/Python_Project/blob/main/The%20Random%20Password%20Generator/2.0%20Flowchart.pdf)
3. [Pseudocode](https://github.com/ChengHeo/Python_Project/blob/main/The%20Random%20Password%20Generator/3.0%20Pseudocode)
4. [Coding](https://github.com/ChengHeo/Python_Project/blob/main/The%20Random%20Password%20Generator/4.1%20Random_Password_v02.py)

#### Problem

There are two version for the coding
1. In the first [version_01](https://github.com/ChengHeo/Python_Project/blob/main/The%20Random%20Password%20Generator/4.0%20Random_Password_v01.py), we using the if-else statement. But in the testing we found the password is work within the range by only once, and the second times is not working. 
2. So we have the second [version_02](https://github.com/ChengHeo/Python_Project/blob/main/The%20Random%20Password%20Generator/4.1%20Random_Password_v02.py) , then we use the while statement, then after the testing we found the coding is working although many times.
