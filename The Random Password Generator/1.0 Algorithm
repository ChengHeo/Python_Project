This project is meant to generate unique passwords as requested by users. 
The passwords will consist of alphanumeric characters to provide utmost security and should not be generated more than once. 
•	The project will greet the user and ask for an input of how many characters the user desired for the password. 
•	Then, the project will check whether the input is within 8-16 characters. 
•	If the condition is met, the program, will proceed to generate a string of characters containing the same number of characters as requested by the user. 
•	If the input exceeds 16 characters or less than 8 characters, the program will reiterate and ask the user to re-input the number.
