From your result and discussion pick the best model.
For example:
Based on the discussion above, it can be synthesised that the KNN model is the 
Best model for this experiment to detect heart disease. This is because it perform better 
on all performance metrics proposed in this experiment. Firstly, it has high accuracy score 
which is a valid measurement due to the fairly balanced dataset.

Finally, the high performance of recall and precision for the KNN model is followed by the high f1-score for 
the model making it the best model to predict heart disease.
