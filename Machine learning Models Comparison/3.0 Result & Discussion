In this part you can compare their output from both models.
For example:
The '*accuracy*' of KNN, which is 89% is higher than the decision tree which is at 80%. This 
signifies that KNN is able to predict whether a person has heart disease or not better than the 
decision tree model. As shown on the confusion matrix, out of the 61 test dataset, 
KNN makes 54 correct diagnosis while the decision tree only makes 49 correct diagnosis.
