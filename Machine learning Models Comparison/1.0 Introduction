At here you can explain both model you choose in this project .
For example the model that i choose in this project is Decision Tree and the K-Nearest Neighbor.
Below just as example
Decision Tree: 
is a supervised learning technique that can be used for both 
classification and regression problems. But it is mostly used in solving classification use 
cases (Jijo & Abdulazeez, 2021). It is called a decision tree because it uses a tree-shaped 
diagram or a branching method to illustrate an action or decision and also its likely outcomes. 
The classification process begins at the treeâ€™s root node and recursively continues until it 
reaches the leaf node with class labels. A split condition is applied at each node to determine 
whether the input value should proceed to the left or right sub-tree until it reaches the leaf 
nodes, where internal nodes represent dataset features, branches represent decision rules and 
the leaf node represents the result

KNN:
KNN is one of the simplest machine learning methods that are used for 
classification (Uddin, Khan, Hossain, & Moni, 2019). It is typically used to classify data 
models based on how their neighbors are classified, which means the KNN algorithm will 
store all the data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. Thus, every time 
there is new data, it will be classified into suitable categories by using the KNN algorithm. 
This algorithm is also known as a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn using 
training data prior to which the data is only stored and there is no calculation or action when 
training data is received. It will only start the learning process time for data classification and 
prediction.
